h3. How to use bigdesk

Once you open bigdesk in your web broswer, you need to <b>point it to the elasticsearch node REST endopint<b>. For example if you run elasticsearch locally the REST endpoint would be <code>http://localhost:9200/</code> by default. In bigdesk from master you can simply specify any endpoint URL in the text field on top of the screen. If you are using bigdesk 1.0.0 (ie. you want to connect bigdesk to elasticearch 0.17.x - 0.18.x) then you need to fill into two different text fields. First you specify <code>hostname</code> of the elasticsearch node into the first text field and its <code>port number</code> into the second text field (but in some situations this can limiting, for example if you run elasticsearch behind firewal).

Then you hit <code>Connect</code> button (it is called <code>START</code> button in bigdesk 1.0.0) and that's it.

Now you should see cluster name and list of its nodes. You can switch between nodes in the cluster, new nodes are added and old nodes are removed automatically on the fly.

You can change bigdesk <b>refresh inerval</b> and <b>amount of data</b> that is displayed by charts.

If you are using bigdesk 1.0.0 you can immediately connect to a particular host, add the <code>host</code>, <code>port</code>, and <code>go</code> parameters to the query string: <code>index.html?host=search.example.com&port=9200&go</code>
